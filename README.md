# Heels Plugin
This is a plugin to be used with the [FFXIVQuickLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

## Installing
Please visit [this](https://github.com/LeonBlade/DalamudPlugins) for instructions on how to install the plugin.

## Usage
To use the plugin, you must have launched the game via FFXIVQuickLauncher.
Then, all you need to do is type `/xlheels` in the in game chat followed by an offset. For example, you might type
`/xlheels 0.11` and this will offset your character 0.11 units off of the ground. In order for the offset to take effect,
you simply need to take a step forward. 

If you wish to disable the effect, simply type `/xlheels 0` or `/xlheels off` in the chat to disable the offset.

## Notes
Due to the nature of this plugin and how it works, you will float off of the ground even while sitting. This plugin also
hasn't been tested extensively, so there may be some issues. Please contact me if you run into any major problems.
